			<p>It is nice to meet you! Let me tell you a little bit more about myself.  First of all, let's talk about my career.
			I am a Software Developer located in Clearfield, Utah. I use to do most of my work in Ruby on Rails, though it has been
			a few years, and I really loved the Ruby language and Rails framework.  Now I work mainly with C# MVC which is also a 
			great language and framework. I am happy with where I am at now, working for ES3 in Clearfield, but am always open to new
			job opportunities.</p>
			<p>As for when I got started developing, well, that would have to be back in high school where I gained an interest in PHP
			and built a few little web applications in it.  After that initial introduction I took a Java course in high school where I
			learned programming was a good fit for me. I started my professional experience as an intern at ES3 back in 2011.  I was 
			originally hired for a summer internship which turned to a part-time internship in the summer of 2012.  My first reposiblities
			were to redo the website as well as update their asset management system to a newer version of Rails.</p>
			<p>Enough about that, let's talk about my other interests.  Well, I like programming side projects in my spare time, snowboarding,
			biking, watching movies, ridding WaveRunners, and mini-golfing.  I still have somewhat of an interest in web hosting and if you
			are interested you can <a href="Web_Hosting">host with me.</a>  The billing system was created on my own.</p>
			<p>Now, if you are looking for some of my work checkout my <a href="https://github.com/travispessetto">GitHub profile.</a> The project
			I am the most proud of right now is <a href="https://travispessetto.github.io/OrigamiSMTP">Origami SMTP</a> which is a fake SMTP server
			with TLS support.</p>
			<p>Well, thanks for stopping by I hope to see you again soon!</p>
